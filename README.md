This addon uses the default **alfresco-access** audit application. Make sure that you have below lines added to alfresco-global.properties:
  ```
  audit.enabled=true
  audit.alfresco-access.enabled=true
  audit.alfresco-access.sub-actions.enabled=true
  ```

The following configuration shows the default permission configuration.
  ```
  #Is a comma-separated list of groups that may use the audit report. 
  #The 'ALL' setting allows all users to use it. The opposite is an empty setting  
  auditreport.allowedGroups=ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS
  
  #The user needs to write permissions for the document
  auditreport.writePermission=true
  
  #Is a comma-separated list of site groups that may use the audit report. 
  auditreport.allowedSiteGroup=SiteManager
  ```  

A custom Document Library Action and link on Document Details page are provided for viewing the audit report for a document.
